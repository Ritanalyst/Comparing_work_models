Comparing_work_models: Smartworking, Hybrid, and Office
This repository contains a data analysis project that compares different work modes — Smartworking, Hybrid, and Office — to assess their impact on both employee and company productivity. The dataset used in this project was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT and has been cleaned and processed using SQL. The findings are visualized with Power BI to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to determine which work mode (Smartworking, Hybrid, or Office) is most beneficial in terms of:

Employee Productivity: How different work modes affect individual performance.
Company Productivity: The overall impact of work modes on business outcomes.
Work-Life Balance: How each work mode influences the balance between work and personal life.
Employee Well-being: Stress levels, physical activity, and sleep quality under different work arrangements.

Dataset Overview
The dataset, created with the assistance of ChatGPT, includes the following columns:

Work_Location: The type of work location (Smartworking, Hybrid, Office).
Hours_Worked_Per_Week: The number of hours worked per week by the employee.
Work_Life_Balance_Rating: A rating indicating how employees perceive their work-life balance (on a defined scale).
Stress_Level: A measure of how stressed employees feel based on their work mode.
Physical_Activity: The level of physical activity an employee engages in
Sleep_Quality: The quality of the employee's sleep

Visualization with Power BI
After cleaning the data, several interactive visualizations were created using Power BI to explore the relationships between work modes, employee productivity, work-life balance, and overall well-being.

Insights
The visualizations help answer key questions such as:

How does employee productivity differ between Smartworking, Hybrid, and Office work modes?
What impact does each work mode have on employees' stress levels, physical activity, and sleep quality?
Which work mode provides the best work-life balance, and how does that correlate with productivity?
